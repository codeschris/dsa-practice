# A repo dedicated to practising DSA concepts

- I created this repo to work on my data structures and algorithms knowledge
- The concepts will be practised in either Python or C/C++ or even both, depending on the field I want to apply for
- Other practices and concepts are learnt through the Udacity Course on Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms
